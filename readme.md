# Backbone Calendar
This is a RequireJS powered calendar and appointments app that I am building for my own site and wanted to share with the community! It is still a work in progress and eventually will have a compiled js file in the master branch!

##Credits
The CSS is a pull from Orman Clark's premium pixels.

The Notepads come from [Little Notepad Design](http://www.premiumpixels.com/freebies/little-notepad-design-psd/)
The backer comes from [Image Fram Slider Thingy](http://www.premiumpixels.com/freebies/image-frame-slider-thingy-ma-bob/)

A thank-you goes out to (Nora Brown)[http://www.norabrowndesign.com] for her article explaining CSS Border-Image for the backer board border.
