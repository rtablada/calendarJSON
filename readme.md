# JSON Calendar

This calendar collection is built based on the Code Igniter Calendar Library.
However instead of outputting HTML, the class is meant to output JSON data to be used in RESTful APIs.

### Development
This is currently in active development and I am working to create the Backbone.JS application to determine formatting for the PHP library.
I am currently running into an issue with my Backbone in creating my views.
